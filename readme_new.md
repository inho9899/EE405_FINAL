## 📌 Project Overview

APT (Advanced Player for Tic-Tac-Toe) is a comprehensive embedded system developed as the final project for **KAIST EE405 (Embedded System Design)**. This system demonstrates the integration of four critical engineering modules to create a fully autonomous tic-tac-toe playing robot:

- **🎯 Vision**: Real-time object detection using YOLOv5
- **🧠 Decision Making**: Unbeatable strategy with Minimax algorithm
- **🔗 Communication**: NFS-based PC ↔ BeagleBone communication
- **⚙️ Control**: Precise motor control with Dynamixel and P-controller

The robot operates autonomously after a human player places their stone and signals turn completion, handling all subsequent analysis and physical actions independently.

## 📷 1. Vision Module: Real-time Object Detection

### YOLOv5 Implementation
The vision system serves as the robot's sensory organ, requiring both **reliability** and **speed**. We implemented **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once v5)**, a CNN-based real-time object detection model that processes images in a single pass to output:

- **Bounding Box Coordinates** (x, y, w, h)
- **Confidence Score** 
- **Class Probability Distribution**

### Technical Specifications
- **Model**: YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
- **Dataset**: 128 images (100 training / 28 validation)
- **Hardware**: Python3 + NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti GPU
- **Camera**: Logicam webcam (ceiling-mounted for consistent viewpoint)
- **Accuracy**: 99.8% (validation set)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.7
- **Inference Time**: < 1 second

### Controlled Environment Setup
- **Lighting**: Consistent studio lighting within portable box
- **Objects**: Screws with colored paper (red/blue) for high contrast
- **Background**: Controlled studio environment for robust detection
- **Camera Position**: Fixed ceiling mount ensuring stable perspective

The high accuracy is achieved through YOLO's robust characteristics combined with simplified object shapes and consistent background conditions.

## 🧠 2. Decision Making: Minimax Algorithm Strategy

### Game Theory Foundation
Tic-tac-toe is a **perfect information game** with deterministic outcomes according to **Zermelo's theorem**. Our implementation uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to guarantee optimal play by recursively simulating all possible moves.

### Algorithm Logic
```
Max Node (Robot Turn): Maximize gain
Min Node (Opponent Turn): Assume opponent plays optimally
Depth-First Search: Simulate to game end
Scoring: Win/Draw/Loss evaluation
Backtracking: Select optimal choice
```

### Implementation Details
- **Language**: C++ for high-performance computation
- **State Space**: 3^9 = 19,683 possible positions
- **Search Strategy**: Complete game tree exploration
- **Execution Time**: < 0.5 seconds for move calculation
- **Strategy**: Guaranteed unbeatable (win or draw)

The algorithm ensures the robot never loses by always selecting moves that minimize potential losses in worst-case scenarios.

## 🔗 3. Communication: NFS-based System Integration

### Hardware Constraint Solution
**Challenge**: BeagleBone Black has only one USB port, occupied by the webcam, preventing traditional I/O methods.

**Solution**: Network File System (NFS) based asynchronous communication.

### Communication Architecture
```
1. PC performs Vision + Decision Making
2. Results written to NFS shared folder as .txt files
3. BeagleBone periodically reads shared files
4. User signals turn completion via SSH terminal
```

### Technical Benefits
- **Simplicity**: Minimal configuration required
- **Reliability**: File-based communication is robust
- **Scalability**: Network-based approach allows system expansion
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking operation model
- **Cost-effective**: Utilizes existing network infrastructure

This demonstrates effective embedded networking design using standard protocols for inter-system communication.

## ⚙️ 4. Control Module: Precision Motor Control

### Hardware Control System
- **Motor**: Dynamixel servo with built-in PID control
- **Controller**: P-type velocity controller (validated in Lab 5)
- **Control Gain**: 4
- **Platform**: BeagleBone Black execution

### P-Controller Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Easy implementation and real-time friendly
- **Responsiveness**: Fast reaction to position errors
- **Reliability**: Minimal parameter tuning required
- **Proven**: Validated through laboratory exercises

### Motion Sequence
1. **Receive coordinates** from vision system
2. **Move gripper** to stone location
3. **Pick up stone** with precise positioning
4. **Transport to target** grid position
5. **Place stone** accurately in designated square

The control system implements a finite state machine approach for reliable sequential operations.
